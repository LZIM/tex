# TeX: Miscellany

I'm going to start keeping my publicly-available LaTeX sources here just in case anyone else wants to play with them.

These will skew towards the typesetting needs of literature scholarship.

## Templates

Model source files of the kind I use as a template for new documents.

## Syllabus framework

In ``syllabus/`` you can see how I make a course syllabus in LaTeX. This is a rather elaborate setup which allows me to make parallel PDF and HTML versions of the same syllabus.

## Class files

Just a curio here, for now: the documentclass used to typeset my Ph.D. thesis.

## Introductory material

Files to play with if you are new to LaTeX.

## Extra scripts

In [bin](bin/), some filters for pandoc. I keep these in my PATH.

[latexmkrc](latexmkrc): a config file for the invaluable `latexmk` build tool. This is my `~/.latexmkrc'.

## More

I'm sporadically blogging about humanities TeXing on my personal blog at [andrewgoldstone.com](http://andrewgoldstone.com/blog/categories/tex).
