# TeX: Miscellany

I'm going to start keeping my publicly-available LaTeX sources here just in case anyone else wants to play with them.

These will skew towards the typesetting needs of literature scholarship.

## Templates

Model source files of the kind I use as a template for new documents.

## Syllabus framework

In [syllabus](syllabus/) you can see how I make a course syllabus in LaTeX. This is a rather elaborate setup which allows me to make parallel PDF and HTML versions of the same syllabus.

## Lecture-slides framework

In [lecture-slides](lecture-slides/), you'll find my setup for generating both slides and notes in PDF from Markdown notes, with some extra bells and whistles made possible by mixing in some beamer configuration tweaks and LaTeX code.

## Class files

Just a curio here, for now: the documentclass used to typeset my Ph.D. thesis.

## Introductory material

Files to play with if you are new to LaTeX.

## Extra scripts

In [bin](bin/), some filters for pandoc. I keep these in my PATH.

[latexmkrc](latexmkrc): a config file for the invaluable `latexmk` build tool for LaTeX. This is my `~/.latexmkrc'.

## More

I'm sporadically blogging about humanities TeXing on my personal blog at [andrewgoldstone.com](http://andrewgoldstone.com/blog/categories/tex).
